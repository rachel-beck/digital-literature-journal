## What I Learned Today

### Fluid Passages

Happy late Easter! This is an update of everything I have learned so far while learning virtually.
- I learned about fluid text and I found a fluid passage in Walden.
- I learned how to use Timeline JS and how to upload manuscript images to my timeline.
- I learned how to rotate and resize manuscript images (or IIIF images).
