## What I Learned Today

### The Coronavirus
- We might not come back to school after break
- If this happens, we'll go digital
- The school isn't telling us anything - no updates
 
### Thoreau
- Communication will always exist, regardless of the form
- Today communication is more easily accessible because of technology
- Would Thoreau's ideas actually work?
- Homeopathy is a medicinal philosophy - "natural way" of trying to heal the body - not home remedies - people have differing views on it - it's not standardly recognized as actually helpful
