## What I Learned Today

### Online Classes

So, we are officially doing online classes, and so far, it kind of sucks. 

I don't like the fact that I have to work from home - it's really difficult to concentrate, and it's been hard trying to force myself to do work.

My professors have all been doing really great jobs transfering my classes to online modules, so I definitely applaud them. I can't imagine how stressful it must be.

I'm used to home being my relax space, but now it has become my work place. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to it, but I really don't want to. This whole coronavirus thing is just screwing everything up, and it's affecting so many people. It's really sad and I hope things get better soon.
